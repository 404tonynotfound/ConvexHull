Anthony Mikhail - Project 1
The program runs as expected. Output points follow the correct format. 
Style and formatting is correct to my knowledge.
Program reads the input from the input.txt file, to test different points, 
change the points in the file, feel free to add as many as you would like to 
test. The scanner will detect the number of points, as long as each points is 
on its own line in the file.
